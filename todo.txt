# improve the readme

# make a page just to search for trails by name
# let users say what hikes they've hiked
# let users make hiking wish lists
# determine valid urls for next_is_valid()
# search for paths
# search by hike name
# fix searches so you're just getting some results

# in login_followup() might not need to do email == submitted_email comparison
# in next_is_valid() need to fix security bug
# in login_followup() possible security issue: can a user use curl to change the user's email address in the request?


#notes:
# must do when creating a table with arrays of enums, or just enums
# t1.create(engine, checkfirst=True)



# remember that hikes are made by people
# remember that people have hiked hikes


# move API user and password to config variables in flask
