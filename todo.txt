# if user enters email for new (non-existant) user, indicate that if they are a new user they need to create an account in some way
# -- could redirect to create new user account


# improve the readme
# add "add/near/<lat_lng>" route so users can easily add a route near a location without having to drag the map around
# add: make first point in hike visible when users add trails
# add: make points removable when adding hikes

# add biome: urban for urban hikes

# make the list of hikes resulting from search prettier
## remove lat-lng list, possibly
## state enums more cleanly (not Terrain.rocky, Terrain.watercrossings, e.g.)

# make a page just to search for trails by name
# let users say what hikes they've hiked
# let users make hiking wish lists
# determine valid urls for next_is_valid()
# search for paths
# search by hike name
# fix searches so you're just getting some results

# in login_followup() might not need to do email == submitted_email comparison
# in next_is_valid() need to fix security bug
# in login_followup() possible security issue: can a user use curl to change the user's email address in the request?


#notes:
# must do when creating a table with arrays of enums, or just enums
# t1.create(engine, checkfirst=True)



# remember that hikes are made by people
# remember that people have hiked hikes


# move API user and password to config variables in flask
